# E-attandance
This is an attendance tracking app called "E-attandance"
I made this application using SQLite and Java.
This app can track attendance for classes.
The app includes features such as the ability to create and customize attendance lists,
mark attendance, and generate reports.
I learned about SQLite while working on this project
